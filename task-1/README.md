## Programming
- First, coordinate value should be within the given range x>=1 and x<=1000000.So, I performed the validation.
- Since I want to calculate minimum number of steps elephant will make I used position 5 to calculate the number of steps.
- So I used division and mod operator to calculate the number of steps.
- If x is 5 or more and divisible by 5 then the number of steps is calculated by a simple division. Otherwise it is simple division +1 for one extra step.
