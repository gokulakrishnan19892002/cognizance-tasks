## Java Program
- Initially, I compiled Java program and I cleared lot of syntax errors such as semicolon and parentheses.
- Next, I cleared logical errors such as addition operator performing multiplication, wrong button labels for start stop buttons.
- Next, I cleared the bugs found in the total time spent in quiz and total count of right answers.
- Also noted that there was a divide by zero error during division when the random number generated for the divisor is 0. Changed the divisor (num2) from 0 to 1 for the division use case.  This ensures that there is no divide by zero errors.
